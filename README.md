## Welcome to 42cursus-cpp-module-03!
This is the forth project featuring C++ at the [42 school].

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to learn the basics of inheritance in C++.
In the first exercise, a simple class is created. In every next exercise
another class is added, until there is a diamond-like inheritance. During
the implemetation of these classes, one can see how to distingish between
the super classes. The main thing to learn is the importance of the ``virtual``
keyword, which allows runtime dispatching.
